                    <p>
                        What you eat can significantly impact PMS symptoms:
                    </p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>When to Seek Medical Help</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your PMS symptoms significantly interfere with your daily life, it might be time to consult a healthcare provider.
                        This is especially important if you experience:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Severe depression or anxiety</li>
                        <li>Symptoms that don't improve with self-care</li>
                        <li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) symptoms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Medical treatments may include hormonal contraceptives, antidepressants, or anti-inflammatory medications, depending
                        on your specific symptoms and needs.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tracking Makes a Difference</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using FlowSync to track your symptoms throughout your cycle can help you identify patterns and determine which management
                        strategies work best for you. This information can also be valuable if you need to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare
                        provider.
